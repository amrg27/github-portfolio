Sales Data Analysis Project

This project showcases the full data analytics workflow:

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed raw sales data in Power Query, handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent fields.

Data Modeling: Designed a star schema with dimension tables (Customers, Products) and a fact table (Sales Orders) to support efficient analysis.

Dashboard Development: Built an interactive sales dashboard to track revenue, discounts, purchasing costs, and shipping performance.

The project demonstrates skills in Power BI, Power Query, and data modeling for business insights.
